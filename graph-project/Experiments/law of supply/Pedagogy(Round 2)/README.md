## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment : Law of Supply

### 1. Story Outline:

Our study of market economies requires us to examine both the demand-side and the supply-side of product and resources markets. Buyers and sellers interact with one another to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges in a market economy, and prices are set based on the demand and supply for a particular good, service or resource. This experiment presents the law of supply, and explains how the supply curve can illustrate this fundamental economic concept.


### 2. Story:

The law of supply is one of the most fundamental principles in economics. It gives the relationship between the price of a commodity and its quantity supplied, when all factors other than price remains unchanged. The relationship mentioned above when represented diagrammatically, it gives rise to the supply curve. However, unlike the demand curve it cannot be generalised. This experiment uses the graphical representation of the supply curve to discuss about its formation, meaning, shift and many more. 


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
The main screen of the simulator consists of two blocks placed horizontally in a sequence. The left, bigger block consists of the drawing area that consists of the graph, while the right, smaller block consists of pop-up texts that describe the on-going changes or the upcoming changes on the left block.


#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
-	Define what individual’s supply is for a particular commodity. 
-   Demonstrate how various quantity at a particular price value is used to create the supply curve.
-   Understand how generalisation is not possible for the supply curve.
-   Choose the structure of supply curve to proceed with.
-   Interpret the supply curve by reading the curve both horizontally and vertically.
-   Select the type of shift in the supply curve to know the reasons behind it.
-   Define what market’s supply is for a particular commodity.
-   Calculate the values from the data provided and fill in the market supply table.
-   List the names of commodities that do not follow the law of supply.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1.	The set-up consists of two blocks placed sequentially in a horizontal manner. The left part consists of all the graphic changes while the right part describes those changes.
2.	To produce the supply curve, an equation can be used to plot the curve on a graph. 
3.	Additionally, the different structures of the curve can be explored by clicking on the ‘straight’ or ‘curved’ buttons respectively.
4.	The different methods of reading the graph can be understood by clicking on the triangular shaped next button.
5.	The shifts in the curve and its corresponding reasons can be identified by clicking on the ‘increase in supply’ and the ‘decrease in supply’ buttons.
6.	Once the market supply is understood, calculations are made to complete the market supply table for a sample commodity.
7.	Exceptions to the law of supply are noted down and explained.



#### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Q 1. Supply refers to the quantity supplied at a particular price for a particular period of time<br>
**a. true**<br>
b. false<br><br>

Q 2. Increase or decrease in supply means<br>
a. change in supply due to change in factors other than its own price<br>
b. shift in supply curve<br>
c. movement along same supply curve<br>
**d. both (a) and (b)**<br><br>

Q 3. A producer’s positively sloped supply curve for a commodity represents<br>
a. a maximum boundary of the producer’s intentions<br>
b. a minimum boundary of the producer’s intentions, <br>
**c. in one sense a maximum and in another sense a minimum boundary of the producer’s intentions**<br>
d. none of the above<br><br>

Q 4. Expansion in supply means that the producers are willing to supply a <br>
**a. larger quantity of the commodity at an increased price**<br>
b. larger quantity of the commodity due to increased taxation on that commodity<br>
c. larger quantity of the commodity at the same price<br>
d. larger quantity of the commodity at a decreased price<br><br>

Q 5. Which of the following will NOT shift the market supply curve of good X?<br>
a. A change in the cost of inputs used to produce good X<br>
b. A change in the technology used to produce X<br>
c. A change number of sellers of good X<br>
**d. A change in the price of good X**<br><br>

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls: Yes

The market demand schedule creation allows pitfalls. It provides the user two chances to enter the data into the table correctly after which the correct values are displayed by the simulator itself. Hints are also allowed to be viewed at any time.


#### 2.6 Conclusion:
The approximate time required to understand the procedure and to start performing the experiment would take about 10 mins. To understand the questions, calculating the data and entering them into their respective input boxes will take approximately another 6 min. To answer the assessment questions, it will take around 5-10 mins. Therefore, in total, to understand and complete the experiment, it will take around 21-26 min.

## 2.7 Equations/formulas:
-
The relation between the price of a commodity and the quantity supplied is a linear relation. Therefore, equations of the form **QSX = –a + bPX** are used to describe the individual’s supply.
[where, QSX stands for the quantity supplied, PX stands for the price of the commodity]
