#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts and modelling


#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Define what individual’s supply is for a particular commodity. <br> | Recall | Define
2.| Demonstrate how various quantity at a particular price value is used to create the supply curve.<br> | Understand | Demonstrate
3.| Choose the structure of supply curve to proceed with. <br> | Apply | Choose
4.| Interpret the supply curve by reading the curve both horizontally and vertically. <br> | Understand | Interpret
5.| Select the type of shift of the supply curve to know the reason behind it. <br> | Apply | Select
6.| Define what the market’s supply is for a particular commodity. <br> | Recall | Define
7.| Calculate the values from the data provided and fill the market supply table. <br> | Apply | Calculate

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative and Summative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> 
<br>
-   A detailed explanation of the law of supply is provided along with references to study materials.  
-   To understand the simulation flow, the reader can navigate to the given buttons and hover the cursor on them to find detailed instructions in a separate text box.
-   A step-by-step procedure is implemented to make it easier for the learner to understand about the graph and the simulation process.
-   Questions will be displayed during and after the simulation to make the assessment clear and to help the student gain independent learning. 
-   Once students have been able to go through the entire virtual lab experiment, they will be able to understand the concepts and apply them to real-world examples.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment questions aligned to the task
:--|:--|:--|:--
1.| State the reason behind the shift in a supply curve. |	Click on the shift button to shift it in any one direction and understand the meaning of it.| Q.1<br> 
2.| State how the income is a factor in obtaining the supply curve of a commodity. |Click on the shift button to shift it in any one direction and understand the factors that affect it. | Q.3<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Click the start button to start the simulator. | Display the simulator setup and define the single producer’s supply of a commodity. | Start the simulator and to recall the theorem.
2.| Understand the theorem and click on the next button. | Display the axes of the graph accompanied by a text describing them. | To setup the price-quantity graph.
3.| Understand the meaning of the axes and click on the next button. |	Display two new buttons (for straight line and curved line) and an arbitrary straight supply line. Define the shape of the supply curve and why generalization of the shape is not possible. | To understand the characteristics of the supply curve. 
4.| Understand the characteristics of the supply curve and click on the next button. | State examples and corresponding curve to explain the shift in the curve. | To understand the reason why the shift in the curve can occur.
5.| Understand the reason for the shifts and click on the next button. |State an example and define the market supply of a commodity and how to calculate it. | To understand how the market supply schedule is obtained.
6.| Understand how the market demand schedule is obtained and click on the next button. | Show examples of some goods that do not follow the law of supply. | To understand the cases where the law of supply does not apply.
7.| Understand the exceptions and click on next button. | Display that the simulator has ended. | Stop the simulator.
