### INTRODUCTION <br>

#### Individual Demand 
*<p>Demand is a consumer-side concept. It is an economic principle referring to a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a price for a specific good or service.
<br> Individual demand is the amount of a product an individual is willing to purchase with his/her limited income at the prevailing set of relative prices over a specified period of time. It is a function of or depends on the price of the commodity, the person’s income, the prices of other commodities and individual tastes. By varying the price of the commodity of interest while keeping constant the individual’s money income and tastes and the price of other commodities, we get the individual’s demand schedule for the commodity.<p>*

#### Market's Demand
*<p>The market or aggregate demand for a commodity gives the alternative amounts of the commodity demanded per time period, at various alternative prices, by all the individuals in the market. It depends on all the factors that determine the individual’s demand as well as the number of buyers
<br> Geometrically, the market’s demand curve is obtained by the horizontal summation of all individual’s demand curves for the commodity<p>*

### FORMULA

The relation between the price of a commodity and the quantity in demand is a linear relation. Therefore, equations of the form **QDX = a – bPX** are used to describe the individual’s demand.<br>
Where:
-   **QDX** stands for the quantity in demand,
-   **a** stands for the factors that influence demand (except price),
-   **b** stand for the slope,
-   **PX** stands for the price of the commodity.

### GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION

<p> graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded for a given period of time is referred to as the Demand Curve. In a typical representation, the price will appear on the left vertical axis, the quantity demanded on the horizontal axis.</p>

### IMPORTANCE

- The demand curve can be an important tool to use when businesses make pricing decisions. This is because the demand curve can show the price point where the consumer responsiveness drops, as well as the price point that elicits the highest demand. Following these two factors, a company can price its products so that it can make profits while keeping customer demand high.

-   The demand curve can show a business which price points are too low to bring in revenue and which price points are too high that the consumer demand decreases. Knowing this information can help businesses make pricing decisions that are balanced between earning decent profits and keeping customer demand for their products high.
